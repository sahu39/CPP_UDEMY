															constexpr tutorial in c++
															===========================
In C++, the `constexpr` keyword is used to declare that the value of a variable or the return value of a function can be evaluated at compile-time.
 This can lead to significant optimizations and can also be used to ensure that certain values are constant and known at compile-time.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of `constexpr` in C++:

### Example: `constexpr` Variable and Function

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// constexpr variable
constexpr int factorial(int n) {
    return (n <= 1) ? 1 : (n * factorial(n - 1));
}

int main() {
    // Using constexpr function
    constexpr int result = factorial(5); // Computed at compile-time
    
    std::cout << "Factorial of 5 is: " << result << std::endl;

    // constexpr variable
    constexpr int compileTimeConstant = 10;
    int array[compileTimeConstant]; // Valid because compileTimeConstant is known at compile-time

    // Non-constexpr variable
    int runTimeVariable = 20;
    // int array2[runTimeVariable]; // Error: array size must be a constant expression

    std::cout << "Compile-time constant: " << compileTimeConstant << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **`constexpr` Function:**
    - The function `factorial` is declared as `constexpr`. This means that if it's called with a compile-time constant argument, the compiler will evaluate it at compile-time.
    - When we call `factorial(5)`, the result is calculated during compilation, not at runtime.

2. **`constexpr` Variable:**
    - `compileTimeConstant` is declared as `constexpr`, ensuring that its value is a constant expression known at compile-time.
    - This allows it to be used in contexts that require a compile-time constant, such as array sizes.

3. **Compile-Time vs. Run-Time:**
    - The variable `compileTimeConstant` can be used in situations where a compile-time constant is required, like the size of an array.
    - A non-`constexpr` variable, such as `runTimeVariable`, cannot be used in such contexts because its value is determined at runtime.

### Benefits of `constexpr`

- **Optimization:** Values known at compile-time can lead to optimized code by the compiler.
- **Compile-Time Assertions:** Helps in creating more robust code by ensuring certain values are constant and correct at compile-time.
- **Enabling Metaprogramming:** Facilitates metaprogramming techniques, allowing for more flexible and powerful template programming.

### Constraints

- The expressions in a `constexpr` function must be evaluable at compile-time.
- Functions and variables marked with `constexpr` should not perform any runtime-only operations such as I/O operations or dynamic memory allocations. 

Using `constexpr` effectively can help write more efficient and safer C++ programs by leveraging compile-time computations.




													static constexpr example in c++:
													==================================
In C++, `static constexpr` is often used in the context of class members. When a class member is declared with `static constexpr`, 
it indicates that the member is a compile-time constant and is shared among all instances of the class.
This is particularly useful for defining constants that are used across multiple objects of the class.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of `static constexpr` in a class:

### Example: `static constexpr` Class Member

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Circle {
public:
    // static constexpr member
    static constexpr double pi = 3.14159265358979323846;

    Circle(double radius) : radius(radius) {}

    double area() const {
        return pi * radius * radius;
    }

private:
    double radius;
};

int main() {
    Circle circle1(5.0);
    Circle circle2(10.0);

    std::cout << "Area of circle with radius 5: " << circle1.area() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Area of circle with radius 10: " << circle2.area() << std::endl;

    // Accessing the static constexpr member directly
    std::cout << "Value of pi: " << Circle::pi << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **`static constexpr` Member:**
    - `static constexpr double pi = 3.14159265358979323846;` declares a static constant `pi` which is a compile-time constant.
    - Because it is `static`, it is shared among all instances of the `Circle` class.
    - Because it is `constexpr`, it is guaranteed to be evaluated at compile-time.

2. **Usage in Class Method:**
    - The `area` method uses the `pi` constant to calculate the area of the circle.
    - This `pi` value is the same across all instances of the `Circle` class and does not require an instance of the class to access.

3. **Accessing `static constexpr` Member:**
    - You can access the `pi` member directly using the class name (`Circle::pi`), without needing an instance of `Circle`.

### Benefits of `static constexpr`

- **Memory Efficiency:** Since the `static constexpr` member is shared among all instances, it saves memory by not duplicating the constant for each 
	instance.
- **Compile-Time Evaluation:** Ensures that the value is evaluated at compile-time, enabling compiler optimizations.
- **Constant Expression:** Can be used in places where compile-time constants are required, like template parameters or array sizes.

### Constraints

- The value of a `static constexpr` member must be known at compile-time.
- It must be initialized in its declaration within the class definition.

Using `static constexpr` for class constants is a powerful feature in C++ that helps in writing efficient and clear code,
especially when dealing with values that are conceptually constant and should not vary between instances.



														static constexpr const example in c++
														============================================
In C++, the combination of `static`, `constexpr`, and `const` keywords can be used to define constants in a class. While `constexpr` already implies `const`, using all three together can still be seen in code, especially for readability or to emphasize the constant nature of the value.

Here's an example demonstrating the use of `static constexpr const` in a class:

### Example: `static constexpr const` Class Member

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Circle {
public:
    // static constexpr const member
    static constexpr const double pi = 3.14159265358979323846;

    Circle(double radius) : radius(radius) {}

    double area() const {
        return pi * radius * radius;
    }

private:
    double radius;
};

int main() {
    Circle circle1(5.0);
    Circle circle2(10.0);

    std::cout << "Area of circle with radius 5: " << circle1.area() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Area of circle with radius 10: " << circle2.area() << std::endl;

    // Accessing the static constexpr const member directly
    std::cout << "Value of pi: " << Circle::pi << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **`static constexpr const` Member:**
    - `static constexpr const double pi = 3.14159265358979323846;` declares a constant `pi` which is a compile-time constant.
    - The `constexpr` keyword ensures that the value is evaluated at compile-time.
    - The `const` keyword emphasizes that the value is constant.
    - The `static` keyword means this constant is shared among all instances of the `Circle` class.

2. **Usage in Class Method:**
    - The `area` method uses the `pi` constant to calculate the area of the circle.
    - This `pi` value is the same for all instances of the `Circle` class and does not require an instance of the class to access it.

3. **Accessing `static constexpr const` Member:**
    - You can access the `pi` member directly using the class name (`Circle::pi`), without needing an instance of `Circle`.

### Additional Points

- **Redundancy:** `constexpr` implies `const`, so adding `const` is somewhat redundant. The use of `static constexpr const` might be seen in code for clarity or to adhere to certain coding standards.
- **Constant Expression:** The combination ensures that the value is a compile-time constant, which can be used in places where a compile-time constant is required, such as array sizes or template parameters.

### Example without `const`

For completeness, here's the same example without the `const` keyword:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Circle {
public:
    // static constexpr member (without const)
    static constexpr double pi = 3.14159265358979323846;

    Circle(double radius) : radius(radius) {}

    double area() const {
        return pi * radius * radius;
    }

private:
    double radius;
};

int main() {
    Circle circle1(5.0);
    Circle circle2(10.0);

    std::cout << "Area of circle with radius 5: " << circle1.area() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Area of circle with radius 10: " << circle2.area() << std::endl;

    // Accessing the static constexpr member directly
    std::cout << "Value of pi: " << Circle::pi << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Both

versions of the example, with and without the `const` keyword, functionally achieve the same result. The main takeaway is that `constexpr` inherently implies `const`, making the use of `const` redundant but sometimes useful for code readability and consistency.

### Key Points to Remember

1. **Compile-Time Constants:** `constexpr` ensures that the value is a constant expression, meaning it can be evaluated at compile-time.
2. **Shared Across Instances:** `static` ensures that the member is shared among all instances of the class.
3. **Redundancy:** Adding `const` is optional since `constexpr` already implies `const`, but it can be included for additional clarity.
4. **Usage Contexts:** These constants can be used in contexts requiring compile-time constants, like array sizes or template parameters.

Using these keywords effectively can lead to clearer, more efficient, and safer C++ code.

=============================================================================================================================================================
														static usage in c++
														=======================
The `static` keyword in C++ can be used to define class members that are shared among all instances of the class. This means that `static` members exist independently of any object of the class. They are not tied to specific instances but to the class itself.

Here's an example to illustrate the use of `static` members in a C++ class:

### Example: `static` Class Member

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Counter {
public:
    // Static member variable declaration
    static int count;

    // Constructor increments the static count
    Counter() {
        ++count;
    }

    // Destructor decrements the static count
    ~Counter() {
        --count;
    }

    // Static member function to get the current count
    static int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
};

// Static member variable definition and initialization
int Counter::count = 0;

int main() {
    std::cout << "Initial count: " << Counter::getCount() << std::endl;

    Counter obj1;
    Counter obj2;
    Counter obj3;

    std::cout << "Count after creating 3 objects: " << Counter::getCount() << std::endl;

    {
        Counter obj4;
        std::cout << "Count after creating another object: " << Counter::getCount() << std::endl;
    } // obj4 goes out of scope and is destroyed

    std::cout << "Count after obj4 is destroyed: " << Counter::getCount() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Static Member Variable:**
    - `static int count;` is declared inside the `Counter` class. This means `count` is a class-level variable, shared among all instances of the `Counter` class.
    - The definition and initialization of `count` must be done outside the class definition using the syntax `int Counter::count = 0;`.

2. **Constructor and Destructor:**
    - The constructor `Counter()` increments the `count` variable each time a new `Counter` object is created.
    - The destructor `~Counter()` decrements the `count` variable each time a `Counter` object is destroyed.

3. **Static Member Function:**
    - `static int getCount()` is a static member function that returns the current value of `count`.
    - Static member functions can only access static member variables. They do not have access to non-static member variables or member functions.

4. **Usage in `main`:**
    - The initial count is displayed using `Counter::getCount()`, which should be `0` because no objects have been created yet.
    - Creating three `Counter` objects (`obj1`, `obj2`, `obj3`) increments the count to `3`.
    - Creating another `Counter` object (`obj4`) within a block scope increments the count to `4`.
    - When `obj4` goes out of scope and is destroyed, the count is decremented back to `3`.

### Benefits of Static Members

- **Memory Efficiency:** Only one copy of the static member is created, regardless of the number of objects instantiated.
- **Shared State:** Useful for maintaining shared state or common data across all instances of a class.
- **Utility Functions:** Static member functions can be used as utility functions that do not require an instance of the class to be called.

### Constraints

- Static members are class-level, not tied to any specific instance.
- Static member functions can only operate on static member variables.
- Initialization of static member variables must be done outside the class definition.

Using static members appropriately can greatly enhance the design and efficiency of your C++ programs.
